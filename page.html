           <p id = 'main'> Hey there! I'm Xinyi, currently navigating the exciting world of Computer Science and Finance at Northeastern University. When I'm not buried in code or deciphering financial markets, you can catch me unleashing my inner Beyoncé or Bruno Mars – singing is my jam! I'm also always on the move, whether it's mastering the latest dance craze or planning my next travel adventure.

                    As a student at Northeastern, I've dived deep into the fascinating intersection of technology and finance. It's a journey that's not just about understanding algorithms and balance sheets, but also about discovering how these powerful tools can shape our world. From developing nifty software solutions to analyzing market trends, I'm all in!
                    
                    But it's not all work and no play. Singing lets me express myself in ways that lines of code can't. Whether it's a solo performance in my room or an impromptu karaoke night with friends, I'm always ready to hit those notes. And when the music stops, you'll find me lacing up my shoes for my next travel escapade. Exploring new cultures, tasting different cuisines, and getting lost in unfamiliar streets – that's my kind of adventure.
                    
                    So, that's a little about me! I'm looking forward to sharing more as I journey through Northeastern, balancing binary trees with balance sheets, and always chasing the next melody and horizon.
